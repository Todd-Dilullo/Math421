#df %>% filter(los <200, sex ==1|sex == 2) %>% ggplot()+
  #geom_point(mapping = aes(x = los, y = total, color = factor(sex)))+
  #labs(title = "Charges vs. Length of Stay", x = "Length of Stay (days)", y = "Total Charges", caption = "This plot shows the relationship between length of stay and total charges for patients") +
  #theme_minimal()


# This plot shows us that the longer patients stay, the higher their total charges will be. There is a relatively even spread of male and female charges
